# Welcome, I'm Matt

If you haven't noticed from my Github activity, I use Github **a lot**. This ranges from random repositories I push some code in that I never complete, to forks of interesting projects, to even small markdown journals which I try to keep track of. Try being the important term here.

Navigating my Github can be... a challenge. Here's a list of projects that I'm most proud of and a short description so you don't waste too much time looking for something interesting.
